# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) Using CNN

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify human emotions based on facial expressions. The model is trained and evaluated on a labeled dataset of facial images and can be deployed for real-time emotion recognition through a web interface.

## Overview

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) plays a critical role in human-computer interaction by enabling machines to understand and respond to human emotions. This project uses a CNN model to classify emotions from facial images and includes a Flask-based web interface for real-time emotion recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions from webcam input.
- **Multi-Class Emotion Classification**: Recognizes multiple emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.).
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with Flask.
- **Accurate Performance**: The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in emotion recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For model training and backend scripting.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and real-time video feed.
- **Flask**: For the web application interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end design of the web interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FER-project.git
